## Part 1

To determine if circle A will collide with circle B as it moves along the straight-line path, we need to take the following steps:

### 1. **Understand the Movement of Circle A:**
   - You know the two endpoints of the straight-line path for circle A. These endpoints represent the start and end points of its motion.
   - You also know the radius of circle A.
   
### 2. **Define the Position of Circle A:**
   - The position of circle A at any given time can be parameterized using a linear interpolation between the two endpoints.
   
   Let's define the path:
   - Let the start point of the path be $ P_1(x_1, y_1) $, and the endpoint be $ P_2(x_2, y_2) $.
   - Let the radius of circle A be $ r_A $.

   The position of circle A at any time $ t $ (where $ t $ ranges from 0 to 1, with $ t = 0 $ being at $ P_1 $ and $ t = 1 $ being at $ P_2 $) can be described by:
   $$
   x_A(t) = x_1 + t(x_2 - x_1)
   $$
   $$
   y_A(t) = y_1 + t(y_2 - y_1)
   $$

### 3. **Check for Potential Collision:**
   - The position of circle B is fixed, so its position is $ P_B(x_B, y_B) $ and its radius is $ r_B $.
   - For circle A to collide with circle B, the distance between the centers of circle A and circle B must be less than or equal to the sum of their radii at some point along the path of circle A.

   The distance between the center of circle A at time $ t $ and circle B is:
   $$
   d(t) = \sqrt{(x_A(t) - x_B)^2 + (y_A(t) - y_B)^2}
   $$

   The collision condition is:
   $$
   d(t) \leq r_A + r_B
   $$

### 4. **Solve for $ t $:**
   - To determine if a collision occurs, you need to check if there exists a value of $ t $ (where $ 0 \leq t \leq 1 $) that satisfies the collision condition.

   If such a $ t $ exists, circle A will collide with circle B at some point along its path. If no such $ t $ exists, circle A will not collide with circle B.

### 5. **Computational Steps:**
   - Set up the equation for $ d(t) $ and solve for $ t $ such that $ d(t) \leq r_A + r_B $.
   - This is typically done by squaring both sides of the inequality to avoid working with the square root:
   $$
   (x_A(t) - x_B)^2 + (y_A(t) - y_B)^2 \leq (r_A + r_B)^2
   $$
   - This will give you a quadratic equation in $ t $. If the quadratic equation has real solutions within the interval $ [0, 1] $, a collision occurs.

If you'd like, I can help you set this up mathematically, or we can proceed with actual numerical computations if you provide the coordinates and radii of both circles!

## Part 2

Alright! Let's continue by working through the mathematical steps to check if circle A will collide with circle B.

### Given:
- Start point of the path for circle A: $ P_1(x_1, y_1) $
- End point of the path for circle A: $ P_2(x_2, y_2) $
- Radius of circle A: $ r_A $
- Center of circle B: $ P_B(x_B, y_B) $
- Radius of circle B: $ r_B $

### Step 1: Parametrize the Position of Circle A
The position of circle A at any time $ t $ (where $ t $ ranges from 0 to 1) is given by:
$$
x_A(t) = x_1 + t(x_2 - x_1)
$$
$$
y_A(t) = y_1 + t(y_2 - y_1)
$$
Where $ t $ is a value between 0 and 1.

### Step 2: Calculate the Distance Between the Centers of Circle A and Circle B
The distance between the center of circle A and the center of circle B at any time $ t $ is:
$$
d(t) = \sqrt{(x_A(t) - x_B)^2 + (y_A(t) - y_B)^2}
$$

We want to determine if this distance ever becomes less than or equal to the sum of the radii, $ r_A + r_B $, which represents a collision.

### Step 3: Set Up the Collision Condition
For a collision to occur, the distance between the centers of the two circles must be less than or equal to the sum of their radii:
$$
d(t) \leq r_A + r_B
$$
Squaring both sides to avoid the square root, we get:
$$
(x_A(t) - x_B)^2 + (y_A(t) - y_B)^2 \leq (r_A + r_B)^2
$$

Substitute the expressions for $ x_A(t) $ and $ y_A(t) $ from Step 1 into this inequality:
$$
\left( (x_1 + t(x_2 - x_1)) - x_B \right)^2 + \left( (y_1 + t(y_2 - y_1)) - y_B \right)^2 \leq (r_A + r_B)^2
$$

### Step 4: Simplify the Expression
Expand both squared terms:
$$
\left( (x_1 - x_B) + t(x_2 - x_1) \right)^2 + \left( (y_1 - y_B) + t(y_2 - y_1) \right)^2 \leq (r_A + r_B)^2
$$

This gives us:
$$
(x_1 - x_B)^2 + 2t(x_1 - x_B)(x_2 - x_1) + t^2(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_1 - y_B)^2 + 2t(y_1 - y_B)(y_2 - y_1) + t^2(y_2 - y_1)^2 \leq (r_A + r_B)^2
$$

This simplifies to:
$$
\left( (x_1 - x_B)^2 + (y_1 - y_B)^2 \right) + 2t \left[ (x_1 - x_B)(x_2 - x_1) + (y_1 - y_B)(y_2 - y_1) \right] + t^2 \left[ (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 \right] \leq (r_A + r_B)^2
$$

### Step 5: Quadratic Equation in $ t $
Now we have a quadratic inequality in $ t $:
$$
At^2 + Bt + C \leq (r_A + r_B)^2
$$
Where:
- $ A = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 $
- $ B = 2 \left[ (x_1 - x_B)(x_2 - x_1) + (y_1 - y_B)(y_2 - y_1) \right] $
- $ C = (x_1 - x_B)^2 + (y_1 - y_B)^2 - (r_A + r_B)^2 $

Thus, the inequality becomes:
$$
A t^2 + B t + C \leq 0
$$

### Step 6: Solve the Quadratic Inequality
To determine if circle A will collide with circle B, we need to solve the quadratic inequality. This is done by finding the roots of the associated quadratic equation:
$$
A t^2 + B t + C = 0
$$
You can solve this using the quadratic formula:
$$
t = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}
$$

The discriminant $ \Delta = B^2 - 4AC $ tells us about the nature of the roots:
- If $ \Delta > 0 $, there are two real roots, meaning circle A will collide with circle B at two distinct times (if the roots are within the range $ [0, 1] $).
- If $ \Delta = 0 $, there is one real root, meaning circle A will just touch circle B at one point (if the root is within the range $ [0, 1] $).
- If $ \Delta < 0 $, there are no real roots, meaning circle A will not collide with circle B.

### Step 7: Check the Roots
If there are real roots, check if they lie within the range $ 0 \leq t \leq 1 $. If at least one of them does, circle A will collide with circle B during its motion.

### Conclusion:
By following this method, you can determine whether circle A will collide with circle B as it moves along its straight-line path.
